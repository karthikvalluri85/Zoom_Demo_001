# 1. Alignment with Conceptual Data Model
## 1.1 ✅ Green Tick: Covered Requirements
- All core entities (Accounts, Users, Meetings, Webinars, Participants, Licenses, Recordings, Chat Messages) are present in the Silver layer physical model.
- Table and column names align with conceptual model conventions and business logic.
- Relationships between entities (PK/FK) are implemented as per the conceptual model.
- Data types (STRING, NUMBER, DATE, TIMESTAMP_NTZ, BOOLEAN) are Snowflake-compatible and match conceptual definitions.

## 1.2 ❌ Red Tick: Missing Requirements
- Some conceptual attributes (e.g., audit log, error log, feature usage) are not represented in the current DDL scripts and should be added for full coverage.
- Table relationships are logical, but not all business key relationships are enforced via FK constraints (as per Silver layer design).

# 2. Source Data Structure Compatibility
## 2.1 ✅ Green Tick: Aligned Elements
- All required source data elements from the Bronze layer are accounted for in the Silver layer tables.
- Data quality, audit, and lineage columns are present for traceability.
- Business rule constraints (CHECK, NOT NULL) are implemented for key fields.

## 2.2 ❌ Red Tick: Misaligned or Missing Elements
- Some enrichment columns (e.g., engagement_score, connection_quality_score, registration_conversion_rate) may require additional ETL logic or source data mapping.
- Not all source system fields are mapped 1:1; some transformations are assumed but not explicitly documented in the DDL.

# 3. Best Practices Assessment
## 3.1 ✅ Green Tick: Adherence to Best Practices
- Consistent naming conventions (sv_ prefix, clear business terms).
- Use of Snowflake-compatible data types and constraints.
- Data quality and audit columns included for monitoring and compliance.
- Logical relationships and referential integrity via PK/FK constraints.

## 3.2 ❌ Red Tick: Deviations from Best Practices
- Some tables lack clustering or partitioning strategies (could improve performance for large datasets).
- Not all business key relationships are enforced technically (intentional for Silver layer, but should be documented).
- Some columns could benefit from further normalization or reference tables (e.g., industry_classification, account_type).

# 4. DDL Script Compatibility
## 4.1 ✅ Snowflake SQL Compatibility
- All DDL scripts use Snowflake-compatible syntax and data types.
- CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS, STRING, NUMBER, BOOLEAN, TIMESTAMP_NTZ, DATE are supported.
- Constraints are implemented using Snowflake's CHECK and FK syntax.

## 4.2 ✅ Used any unsupported Snowflake features
- No unsupported or deprecated Snowflake features detected.
- No use of unsupported data types or syntax.

# 5. Identified Issues and Recommendations
- Add missing tables for error log, audit log, and feature usage to fully align with conceptual model.
- Document business key relationships that are logical but not enforced by FK constraints.
- Consider adding clustering keys or partitioning strategies for large tables (e.g., sv_meetings, sv_participants).
- Normalize reference data columns (e.g., account_type, industry_classification) using lookup tables.
- Enhance documentation for transformation logic and source-to-target mapping.
