## Overview

This document defines the Model Data Constraints for the Zoom Platform Analytics System, which captures, analyzes, and reports on comprehensive meeting and collaboration data within the Zoom ecosystem. These constraints ensure data integrity, compliance, and quality for analytics and decision-making processes.

## 1. Data Expectations

### 1.1 Data Completeness
- **Meeting Data Completeness**: All core meeting attributes (Meeting ID, Start Time, End Time, Host ID) must be present for every meeting record
- **Participant Data Completeness**: Minimum required participant information (User ID, Join Time, Leave Time) must be captured for all meeting participants
- **Quality Metrics Completeness**: Audio/video quality metrics must be recorded for at least 95% of meeting sessions
- **Usage Analytics Completeness**: Daily, weekly, and monthly aggregation data must be complete with no gaps in time series

### 1.2 Data Accuracy
- **Timestamp Accuracy**: All timestamps must be accurate to the second and stored in UTC format
- **Duration Calculations**: Meeting and participant durations must be calculated accurately based on actual join/leave times
- **Quality Metrics Accuracy**: Audio/video quality scores must reflect actual technical performance measurements
- **User Attribution Accuracy**: All activities must be correctly attributed to the appropriate user accounts and organizational units

### 1.3 Data Format Standards
- **Date/Time Format**: ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) for all timestamp fields
- **Identifier Format**: Consistent alphanumeric format for all system-generated IDs
- **Numeric Precision**: Quality metrics stored with appropriate decimal precision (2 decimal places for percentages, 3 for ratios)
- **Text Encoding**: UTF-8 encoding for all text fields to support international characters

### 1.4 Data Consistency
- **Cross-Entity Consistency**: Meeting data must be consistent across all related entities (participants, quality metrics, recordings)
- **Temporal Consistency**: Time-based relationships must be logically consistent (join time < leave time, start time < end time)
- **Hierarchical Consistency**: Organizational hierarchy data must maintain consistent parent-child relationships
- **Status Consistency**: Entity status values must be consistent across all related records

## 2. Constraints

### 2.1 Mandatory Fields

#### Meeting Entity

- User Status
- Created Date
- Last Login Date

#### Participant Entity

- Meeting ID (Foreign Key)
- User ID (Foreign Key)
- Join Time
- Leave Time
- Participant Role

#### Account Entity

- Account Type
- Subscription Plan
- Created Date
- Status

### 2.2 Uniqueness Constraints
- **Meeting ID**: Must be unique across the entire system
- **User Email**: Must be unique within each account
- **Participant Session**: Combination of Meeting ID + User ID + Join Time must be unique
- **Account Name**: Must be unique across the platform
- **Recording ID**: Must be unique across all meetings

### 2.3 Data Type Limitations
- **Meeting Duration**: Integer (minutes), range 0-1440 (24 hours maximum)
- **Participant Count**: Integer, range 1-1000 (based on Zoom limits)
- **Quality Scores**: Decimal (0.00-100.00)
- **Audio/Video Bitrate**: Integer (kbps), range 0-10000
- **File Sizes**: BigInt (bytes) for recording and file storage metrics
- **Percentage Values**: Decimal (0.00-100.00)

### 2.4 Dependencies
- **Meeting-Participant Dependency**: Participants cannot exist without a valid meeting
- **User-Account Dependency**: Users must belong to a valid, active account
- **Recording-Meeting Dependency**: Recordings must be associated with a valid meeting
- **Quality Metrics Dependency**: Quality data must be linked to valid meeting sessions
- **Department-Account Dependency**: Departments must belong to valid accounts

### 2.5 Referential Integrity
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: All foreign key relationships must reference existing parent records
- **Cascade Rules**: Deletion of parent records must follow defined cascade rules
- **Orphan Prevention**: No orphaned records allowed in child tables
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: All cross-references between entities must be validated

## 3. Business Rules

### 3.1 Meeting Management Rules
- **Meeting Duration Logic**: Calculated duration must equal (End Time - Start Time)
- **Host Validation**: Meeting host must be an active user within the account
- **Concurrent Meeting Limits**: Users cannot host more meetings than their license allows
- **Meeting Status Transitions**: Status changes must follow defined workflow (Scheduled → In Progress → Completed/Cancelled)
- **Recurring Meeting Handling**: Recurring meetings must maintain parent-child relationships

### 3.2 Participant Engagement Rules
- **Join/Leave Logic**: Leave time must be greater than or equal to join time
- **Multiple Sessions**: Users can have multiple join/leave sessions within the same meeting
- **Engagement Calculation**: Total engagement time = sum of all (leave time - join time) sessions
- **Participant Limits**: Number of participants cannot exceed account or meeting type limits
- **Role Assignments**: Participant roles must be valid for the meeting type and user permissions

### 3.3 Quality Monitoring Rules
- **Quality Thresholds**: Audio quality below 70% triggers quality alerts
- **Network Performance**: Packet loss above 5% indicates poor connection quality
- **Device Performance**: CPU usage above 80% during meetings indicates performance issues
- **Quality Aggregation**: Overall meeting quality is weighted average of all participant quality scores
- **Quality Reporting**: Quality metrics must be available within 5 minutes of meeting end

### 3.4 Usage Analytics Rules
- **Daily Aggregation**: Usage statistics must be aggregated daily by 2 AM UTC
- **License Utilization**: Active user count cannot exceed licensed user count
- **Storage Limits**: Recording storage cannot exceed account storage limits
- **Retention Policies**: Data retention must comply with account-specific retention settings
- **Peak Usage Calculation**: Peak concurrent usage calculated as maximum simultaneous active meetings

### 3.5 Organizational Reporting Rules
- **Hierarchy Reporting**: Reports must respect organizational hierarchy and user permissions
- **Data Privacy**: Personal user data must be anonymized in department-level reports
- **Access Control**: Users can only access data for their organizational scope
- **Audit Trail**: All data access and modifications must be logged for audit purposes
- **Compliance Reporting**: Reports must include required compliance and governance metrics

### 3.6 Data Processing Rules
- **Real-time Processing**: Meeting events must be processed within 30 seconds of occurrence
- **Batch Processing**: Historical data processing must complete within defined maintenance windows
- **Error Handling**: Failed data processing must trigger alerts and retry mechanisms
- **Data Validation**: All incoming data must pass validation rules before storage
- **Transformation Logic**: Data transformations must be reversible and auditable

### 3.7 Performance Optimization Rules
- **Query Performance**: All analytical queries must complete within 30 seconds
- **Index Maintenance**: Database indexes must be maintained for optimal query performance
- **Data Archiving**: Historical data older than retention period must be archived
- **Cache Management**: Frequently accessed data must be cached for improved performance
- **Resource Allocation**: System resources must be allocated based on usage patterns and priorities

## 4. Validation Rules

### 4.1 Data Entry Validation
- Email addresses must follow valid email format patterns
- Phone numbers must follow international format standards
- Time zones must be valid IANA time zone identifiers
- URLs must be properly formatted and accessible
- File formats must be supported Zoom file types

### 4.2 Business Logic Validation
- Meeting end time must be after start time
