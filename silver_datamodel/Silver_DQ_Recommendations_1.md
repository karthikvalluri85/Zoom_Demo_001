# Silver Layer Data Quality Recommendations - Zoom Platform Analytics System

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive data quality recommendations for the Silver Layer in the Zoom Platform Analytics System's Medallion architecture. These recommendations are based on the analysis of the Bronze Physical data model, Data Constraints, and business rules to ensure data integrity, accuracy, and compliance across all entities in the system.

## Recommended Data Quality Checks:

### 1. Meeting Entity Data Quality Checks

#### 1.1 Meeting ID Validation
- **Rationale**: Meeting ID is the primary key and must be unique and not null to ensure data integrity
- **SQL Example**: 
```sql
-- Check for null Meeting IDs
SELECT COUNT(*) as null_meeting_ids
FROM SILVER.MEETINGS 
WHERE MEETING_ID IS NULL;

-- Check for duplicate Meeting IDs
SELECT MEETING_ID, COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
FROM SILVER.MEETINGS 
GROUP BY MEETING_ID 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Check Meeting ID format (alphanumeric)
SELECT COUNT(*) as invalid_format_count
FROM SILVER.MEETINGS 
WHERE NOT REGEXP_LIKE(MEETING_ID, '^[A-Za-z0-9]+$');
```

#### 1.2 Meeting Time Validation
- **Rationale**: Meeting start and end times must be valid timestamps and end time must be after start time
- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Check for null start/end times
SELECT COUNT(*) as null_times
FROM SILVER.MEETINGS 
WHERE MEETING_START_TIME IS NULL OR MEETING_END_TIME IS NULL;

-- Check for invalid time relationships
SELECT COUNT(*) as invalid_time_sequence
FROM SILVER.MEETINGS 
WHERE MEETING_END_TIME <= MEETING_START_TIME;

-- Check for unrealistic meeting durations (> 48 hours)
SELECT COUNT(*) as excessive_duration
FROM SILVER.MEETINGS 
WHERE DATEDIFF('MINUTE', MEETING_START_TIME, MEETING_END_TIME) > 2880;
```

#### 1.3 Meeting Duration Consistency
- **Rationale**: Meeting duration should match calculated duration from start/end times
- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Check duration consistency
SELECT COUNT(*) as inconsistent_duration
FROM SILVER.MEETINGS 
WHERE ABS(MEETING_DURATION - DATEDIFF('MINUTE', MEETING_START_TIME, MEETING_END_TIME)) > 1;

-- Check for invalid duration range (0-2880 minutes)
SELECT COUNT(*) as invalid_duration_range
FROM SILVER.MEETINGS 
WHERE MEETING_DURATION < 0 OR MEETING_DURATION > 2880;
```

#### 1.4 Foreign Key Integrity
- **Rationale**: Account ID and Host User ID must reference valid records in parent tables
- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Check Account ID foreign key integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) as invalid_account_refs
FROM SILVER.MEETINGS m
LEFT JOIN SILVER.ACCOUNTS a ON m.ACCOUNT_ID = a.ACCOUNT_ID
WHERE a.ACCOUNT_ID IS NULL;

-- Check Host User ID foreign key integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) as invalid_host_refs
FROM SILVER.MEETINGS m
LEFT JOIN SILVER.USERS u ON m.HOST_USER_ID = u.USER_ID
WHERE u.USER_ID IS NULL;
```

### 2. Webinar Entity Data Quality Checks

#### 2.1 Webinar Capacity Validation
- **Rationale**: Actual attendees should not exceed maximum attendees, and both should be within valid ranges
- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Check attendee capacity constraints
SELECT COUNT(*) as capacity_violations
FROM SILVER.WEBINARS 
WHERE ACTUAL_ATTENDEES > MAX_ATTENDEES;

-- Check valid attendee ranges
SELECT COUNT(*) as invalid_attendee_range
FROM SILVER.WEBINARS 
WHERE MAX_ATTENDEES < 1 OR MAX_ATTENDEES > 10000 
   OR ACTUAL_ATTENDEES < 0 OR ACTUAL_ATTENDEES > 10000;
```

#### 2.2 Registration Logic Validation
- **Rationale**: Registration count should align with registration requirements and actual attendance
- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Check registration logic consistency
SELECT COUNT(*) as registration_inconsistency
FROM SILVER.WEBINARS 
WHERE REGISTRATION_REQUIRED = TRUE AND REGISTRATION_COUNT = 0 AND ACTUAL_ATTENDEES > 0;

-- Check registration count validity
SELECT COUNT(*) as invalid_registration_count
FROM SILVER.WEBINARS 
WHERE REGISTRATION_COUNT < 0;
```

### 3. User Entity Data Quality Checks

#### 3.1 Email Address Validation
- **Rationale**: Email addresses must be unique within account and follow RFC 5322 format
- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Check email format validation
SELECT COUNT(*) as invalid_email_format
FROM SILVER.USERS 
WHERE NOT REGEXP_LIKE(EMAIL_ADDRESS, '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$');

-- Check email uniqueness within account
SELECT ACCOUNT_ID, EMAIL_ADDRESS, COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
FROM SILVER.USERS 
GROUP BY ACCOUNT_ID, EMAIL_ADDRESS 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

#### 3.2 User Status and Date Validation
- **Rationale**: User status must be valid and last login should be after creation date
- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Check valid user status values
SELECT COUNT(*) as invalid_status
FROM SILVER.USERS 
WHERE USER_STATUS NOT IN ('ACTIVE', 'INACTIVE', 'SUSPENDED', 'PENDING');

-- Check date logic consistency
SELECT COUNT(*) as invalid_date_sequence
FROM SILVER.USERS 
WHERE LAST_LOGIN_DATE < CREATED_DATE;
```

### 4. Participant Entity Data Quality Checks

- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Check join/leave time logic
SELECT COUNT(*) as invalid_session_times
FROM SILVER.PARTICIPANTS p
JOIN SILVER.MEETINGS m ON p.MEETING_ID = m.MEETING_ID
WHERE p.LEAVE_TIME < p.JOIN_TIME 
   OR p.JOIN_TIME < m.MEETING_START_TIME 
   OR p.LEAVE_TIME > m.MEETING_END_TIME;
```

#### 4.2 Engagement Score Validation

SELECT COUNT(*) as invalid_engagement_scores
FROM SILVER.PARTICIPANTS 
WHERE ENGAGEMENT_SCORE < 0.0000 OR ENGAGEMENT_SCORE > 1.0000;
```

#### 4.3 Duration Consistency Check
- **Rationale**: Duration should match calculated time from join/leave timestamps
- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Check duration consistency
SELECT COUNT(*) as inconsistent_duration
FROM SILVER.PARTICIPANTS 
WHERE LEAVE_TIME IS NOT NULL 
  AND ABS(DURATION_MINUTES - DATEDIFF('MINUTE', JOIN_TIME, LEAVE_TIME)) > 1;
```

### 5. Recording Entity Data Quality Checks

- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Check participant count consistency
WITH participant_counts AS (
  SELECT MEETING_ID, COUNT(*) as actual_participant_count
  FROM SILVER.PARTICIPANTS 
  GROUP BY MEETING_ID
)
SELECT COUNT(*) as inconsistent_participant_counts

- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Check recording-meeting relationship
SELECT COUNT(*) as orphaned_recordings
FROM SILVER.RECORDINGS r
LEFT JOIN SILVER.MEETINGS m ON r.MEETING_ID = m.MEETING_ID
WHERE m.MEETING_ID IS NULL;
```

### 10. Business Rule Validation Checks

#### 10.1 Quality Threshold Monitoring
- **Rationale**: Audio quality below 75% should be flagged as per business rules
- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Identify meetings with poor audio quality
SELECT MEETING_ID, AVG(AUDIO_QUALITY_SCORE) as avg_audio_quality
FROM SILVER.QUALITY_METRICS 
GROUP BY MEETING_ID 
HAVING AVG(AUDIO_QUALITY_SCORE) < 75.000;

```

#### 10.2 License Utilization Monitoring
- **Rationale**: Active user count should not exceed licensed user count
- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Check license utilization
WITH active_users AS (
  SELECT ACCOUNT_ID, COUNT(*) as active_user_count
  FROM SILVER.USERS 
  WHERE USER_STATUS = 'ACTIVE'
  GROUP BY ACCOUNT_ID
)
SELECT a.ACCOUNT_ID, a.LICENSE_COUNT, au.active_user_count
FROM SILVER.ACCOUNTS a
JOIN active_users au ON a.ACCOUNT_ID = au.ACCOUNT_ID
WHERE au.active_user_count > a.LICENSE_COUNT;
```

### 11. Data Completeness Checks

#### 11.1 Mandatory Field Completeness
- **Rationale**: All mandatory fields must be populated as per business requirements
- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Check completeness of mandatory meeting fields
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN MEETING_ID IS NULL THEN 1 END) as missing_meeting_id,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN ACCOUNT_ID IS NULL THEN 1 END) as missing_account_id,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN HOST_USER_ID IS NULL THEN 1 END) as missing_host_id,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN MEETING_START_TIME IS NULL THEN 1 END) as missing_start_time,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN MEETING_END_TIME IS NULL THEN 1 END) as missing_end_time
FROM SILVER.MEETINGS;
```

#### 11.2 Critical Data Availability
- **Rationale**: Quality metrics should be available for at least 98% of meeting sessions
- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Check quality metrics coverage
WITH meeting_quality_coverage AS (
  SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT m.MEETING_ID) as total_meetings,
    COUNT(DISTINCT qm.MEETING_ID) as meetings_with_quality_data
  FROM SILVER.MEETINGS m
  LEFT JOIN SILVER.QUALITY_METRICS qm ON m.MEETING_ID = qm.MEETING_ID
)
SELECT 
  total_meetings,
  meetings_with_quality_data,
  (meetings_with_quality_data * 100.0 / total_meetings) as coverage_percentage
FROM meeting_quality_coverage;
```

### 12. Data Freshness and Timeliness Checks

#### 12.1 Data Processing Timeliness
- **Rationale**: Meeting events should be processed within 15 seconds of occurrence
- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Check processing delay (assuming PROCESSED_TIMESTAMP field exists)
SELECT COUNT(*) as delayed_processing
FROM SILVER.MEETINGS 
WHERE DATEDIFF('SECOND', MEETING_END_TIME, PROCESSED_TIMESTAMP) > 15;
```

#### 12.2 Data Recency Validation
- **Rationale**: Ensure data is being updated regularly and no stale data exists
- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Check for stale user login data (no login in last 90 days for active users)
SELECT COUNT(*) as potentially_stale_users
FROM SILVER.USERS 
WHERE USER_STATUS = 'ACTIVE' 
  AND LAST_LOGIN_DATE < DATEADD('DAY', -90, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP());
```

### 13. Security and Compliance Validation

#### 13.1 Encryption Status Validation
- **Rationale**: All recordings and sensitive chat messages must be encrypted
- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Check recording encryption compliance
SELECT COUNT(*) as unencrypted_recordings
FROM SILVER.RECORDINGS 
WHERE ENCRYPTION_STATUS = FALSE;

-- Check chat message encryption levels
SELECT ENCRYPTION_LEVEL, COUNT(*) as message_count
FROM SILVER.CHAT_MESSAGES 
GROUP BY ENCRYPTION_LEVEL;
```

#### 13.2 Data Retention Compliance
- **Rationale**: Ensure data retention policies are being followed
- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Check for recordings past retention date
SELECT COUNT(*) as overdue_recordings
FROM SILVER.RECORDINGS 
WHERE RETENTION_DATE < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP();
```

### 14. Performance and Volume Monitoring

#### 14.1 Data Volume Validation
- **Rationale**: Monitor data volumes to ensure system performance and identify anomalies
- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Daily meeting volume monitoring
SELECT 
  DATE(MEETING_START_TIME) as meeting_date,
  COUNT(*) as daily_meeting_count,
  AVG(PARTICIPANT_COUNT) as avg_participants_per_meeting
FROM SILVER.MEETINGS 
WHERE MEETING_START_TIME >= DATEADD('DAY', -30, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
GROUP BY DATE(MEETING_START_TIME)
ORDER BY meeting_date;
```

#### 14.2 System Resource Utilization
- **Rationale**: Monitor CPU usage and system performance metrics
- **SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Check high CPU usage incidents
SELECT COUNT(*) as high_cpu_incidents
FROM SILVER.QUALITY_METRICS 
WHERE CPU_USAGE_PERCENT > 75.000;
```
